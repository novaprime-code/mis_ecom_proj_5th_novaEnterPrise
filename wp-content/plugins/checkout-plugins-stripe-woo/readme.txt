## OFFER ONE CLICK CHECKOUT WITH EXPRESS PAY ##

The future of ecommerce checkout is express pay options that make it fast to place orders because your buyers don’t need to fill out the checkout form. All your buyers have to do is click one button and their order is complete.

Stripe For WooCommerce makes it easy to start offering express payment options such as Apple Pay and Google Pay and fully customize the style, design, and location of these express pay buttons.

You will be able to visually style the express pay buttons to match your brand. Next you can choose where you want to show the express pay buttons, on the product page, on the cart page, and on the checkout page.

Stripe for WooCommerce offers complete flexibility without needing to understand a single line of code.
